## üìù Command Development Guidelines

### Command File Structure

Each command should follow this structure in a `.md` file:

````markdown
# Command Name

<task>
Brief description of what the command does
</task>

<context>
Rules, constraints, and context for the command
</context>

<workflow>
1. Step-by-step process
2. Detailed workflow
3. Error handling
</workflow>

<safety_checks>

- ‚úÖ What the command should do
- ‚ùå What the command should never do
  </safety_checks>

<example_usage>

## Basic Usage

```bash
/command example
```
````

## Advanced Usage

```bash
/command --option value
```

</example_usage>

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS (description of arguments)

```

### Command Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, action-oriented names
- Use kebab-case for multi-word commands
- Examples: `git-commit`, `pr-create`, `k8s-deploy`

### Safety Guidelines

All commands must include safety checks:

- **Never execute destructive operations without confirmation**
- **Always validate inputs and environment**
- **Provide clear error messages**
- **Include rollback instructions when applicable**
- **Follow the principle of least privilege**

### Testing Requirements

Before submitting a command:

1. **Test in Isolation** - Test the command in a clean environment
2. **Test Edge Cases** - Test with invalid inputs, missing dependencies
3. **Test Safety Checks** - Verify safety mechanisms work correctly
4. **Test Documentation** - Ensure examples work as documented

## üìö Documentation Standards

### README Updates

When adding new commands or features:

1. Update the main README.md with:
   - Command description
   - Usage examples
   - Any new dependencies or requirements

2. Update the command table with new entries

3. Add any new configuration requirements

### Command Documentation

Each command file should include:

- Clear task description
- Complete workflow steps
- Safety checks and validations
- Working examples
- Argument descriptions
- Error handling information

### Examples Directory

Add practical examples in the `examples/` directory:

- `examples/commands/` - Command usage examples
- `examples/configs/` - Configuration examples
- `examples/workflows/` - Complete workflow examples

## üîß Code Standards

### Markdown Formatting

- Use proper markdown syntax
- Include code blocks with language specification
- Use consistent heading levels
- Include table of contents for long documents

### Command Structure

- Keep commands focused on single responsibilities
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Follow the established patterns

### Git Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```
