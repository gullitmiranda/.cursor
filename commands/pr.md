# Pull Request Management

<task>
You are a pull request management specialist that handles the complete PR lifecycle: creation, validation, preparation, and readiness management using GitHub CLI and comprehensive quality gates.
</task>

<context>
PR Management Rules:
- Always use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations
- Ensure branch has been created and changes committed before PR creation
- Generate conventional commit format titles: `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`
- Run quality checks before PR creation
- Validate PR completeness and readiness for review
- Include Linear issue references for auto-linking, but only if they are present in the commit message or prompt

## Main Command Routes

### `/pr` - Create Pull Request

1. **Pre-flight Checks**:

   - Verify we're on a feature branch (not main/master)
   - Check that branch has commits ahead of base branch
   - Ensure branch is pushed to remote repository
   - Confirm GitHub CLI is authenticated

2. **Analyze Changes**:

   - Run `git log main..HEAD` or `git log master..HEAD` to see commits
   - Run `git diff main...HEAD` to see all changes
   - Identify primary change type (feat, fix, chore, etc.)
   - Determine scope from affected components
   - Check for Linear issue references in commits

3. **Generate PR Title**:

   - Format: `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`
   - Use conventional commit format
   - Summarize the overall change, not individual commits
   - Keep under 72 characters

4. **Build PR Description**:

   - Check for `.github/pull_request_template.md`
   - If template exists, use as base structure
   - Generate Summary section from commit messages
   - Add Test Plan with checklist items
   - Include Linear issue links if mentioned
   - Remove template placeholders if no data available

5. **Create PR**:
   - Use `gh pr create` with title and body
   - Use heredoc for proper formatting
   - Set base branch (usually main)
   - Return PR URL for user as a markdown link

### `/pr check` or `/pr validate` or `/pr review` - PR Validation

1. **Quality Gate Checks**:

   - Run project tests (detect test framework automatically)
   - Run linting and formatting checks
   - Run build/compilation if applicable
   - Check for security vulnerabilities
   - Verify all quality gates pass

2. **PR Detection**:

   - Check if current branch has an associated PR
   - Get PR details using `gh pr view`
   - If no PR exists, suggest creating one with `/pr`

3. **Title Validation**:

   - Verify title follows conventional commit format
   - Check title length (recommended: under 72 characters)
   - Ensure title accurately summarizes the changes

4. **Description Completeness**:

   - Check for required template sections (Summary, Test Plan)
   - Verify description provides sufficient context
   - Look for linked issues or related work
   - Ensure test plan is actionable

5. **Metadata Check**:

   - Verify assignees are set (usually the author)
   - Check for appropriate labels based on change type
   - Review milestone assignment if applicable
   - Confirm reviewers are requested

6. **CI/CD Status**:
   - Check status of required checks (tests, linting, build)
   - Identify any failing checks that block merge
   - Show check details and failure reasons
   - Suggest fixes for common check failures

### `/pr ready` - Mark PR Ready for Review

1. **PR Status Check**:

   - Get current PR details using `gh pr view`
   - Check if PR is in draft status
   - Verify PR is associated with current branch
   - Confirm PR has not been merged or closed

2. **Quality Validation**:

   - Run validation checks to ensure completeness
   - Ensure all required template sections are filled
   - Verify conventional commit title format
   - Check that description provides adequate context

3. **CI/CD Verification**:

   - Check status of all required checks
   - Wait for in-progress checks to complete (with timeout)
   - Identify any failing checks that block review
   - Ensure no merge conflicts exist

4. **Reviewer Assignment**:

   - Detect appropriate reviewers based on:
     - Code owners (CODEOWNERS file)
     - Changed file patterns
     - Team assignments
     - Previous reviewers on similar changes
   - Request reviews from selected team members
   - Assign PR to author if not already assigned

5. **Ready Status Update**:
   - Remove draft status if currently draft
   - Apply "ready-for-review" label
   - Add change-type labels (feature, bugfix, etc.)
   - Update PR status to ready for review
     </workflow>

## Project Quality Checks

### Documentation-Based Quality Gates

1. **Check for CONTRIBUTING.md**:

   - Look for `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` in project root
   - Parse quality check commands from documentation
   - Extract test, lint, build, and security commands
   - Follow project-specific guidelines

2. **Fallback to README.md**:

   - If no CONTRIBUTING.md found, check `README.md`
   - Look for development setup and testing sections
   - Extract available quality check commands
   - Use common patterns for different project types

3. **Auto-Detection Fallback**:
   - If no documentation found, auto-detect based on project structure
   - Check for common config files (package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.)
   - Use standard commands for detected project types

### Quality Check Execution

```bash
# 1. Check for project documentation
if [ -f "CONTRIBUTING.md" ]; then
  # Parse commands from CONTRIBUTING.md
elif [ -f ".github/CONTRIBUTING.md" ]; then
  # Parse commands from .github/CONTRIBUTING.md
elif [ -f "README.md" ]; then
  # Parse commands from README.md
else
  # Auto-detect based on project structure
fi

# 2. Execute quality checks in order
# - Tests (from documentation or auto-detected)
# - Linting (from documentation or auto-detected)
# - Build (from documentation or auto-detected)
# - Security (from documentation or auto-detected)
```

### Documentation Parsing

Look for common patterns in documentation:

- **Test commands**: `npm test`, `yarn test`, `pytest`, `cargo test`, `go test`
- **Lint commands**: `npm run lint`, `flake8`, `cargo clippy`, `gofmt`
- **Build commands**: `npm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build`, `mvn compile`
- **Security commands**: `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`

### Project Type Detection

```bash
# Detect project type for fallback commands
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
  # Node.js project
elif [ -f "Cargo.toml" ]; then
  # Rust project
elif [ -f "go.mod" ]; then
  # Go project
elif [ -f "pom.xml" ]; then
  # Maven project
elif [ -f "build.gradle" ]; then
  # Gradle project
elif [ -f "requirements.txt" ] || [ -f "pyproject.toml" ]; then
  # Python project
fi
```
