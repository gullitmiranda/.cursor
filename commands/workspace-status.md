# Workspace Status Command

## Description

Multi-repository workspace status overview with comprehensive analysis.

## Workflow

1. Always check current working directory and understand repository boundaries
2. Never assume single git repository when working in multi-repo workspace
3. Always verify which repository operations are targeting
4. Identify which specific repository changes belong to
5. Navigate to correct repository directory before running git operations
6. Treat each repository as separate entity with its own git state

## Multi-Repository Handling

- When working with staged changes, identify which specific repository they belong to
- Provide clear indication of repository boundaries
- Show status for each repository found in workspace
- Highlight any cross-repository dependencies or conflicts

## Error Prevention

- Always ask for clarification when workspace structure is unclear
- Confirm target repository before running git commands
- Use non-destructive git commands first (git stash, git log) to understand situation

## Output Format
